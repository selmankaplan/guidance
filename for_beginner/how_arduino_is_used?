To begin with, we need to install an Arduino IDE (which includes the interpreter and compiler). The default Arduino software is sufficient, so we can use that. I’ve added a link for the Arduino installation below:

I think the best way to learn Arduino and coding is through practice, so I’ll share some real practice codes below.

This playlist is sufficient. 

In addition, if you do not have enough sensors or components to create the circuits you want, you can use "Tinkercad".
