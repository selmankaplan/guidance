Now, we are taking a few steps forward and developing some projects.


we'll have to generate a some user interface for some projects. Therefor, we need to know some python UI library such as TKinter, pyQT etc. TKinter is sufficient for us.

After that we have to know that we can find any library for any project in python.

I like the image processing :) We can begin with it.
