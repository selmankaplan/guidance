# guide

This repository was created to help beginners strengthen their understanding of logic structures, algorithms, and software development skills. I explain each step as clearly as possible to make it easy to follow. The repo is divided into some little parts:

	1.	Basic arduino steps for learning how Arduino is used. It will helps us understan the logic.
	2.	Basic steps for learning how Python is used. When we take a few steps forward... 
	3.	Examples of machine learning applications. I think It could be fun :)
