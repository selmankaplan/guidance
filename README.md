# guide_for_beginner

This repository was created to help beginners strengthen their understanding of logic structures, algorithms, and software development skills. I explain each step as clearly as possible to make it easy to follow. The repo is divided into two parts:

	1.	Basic steps for learning how Python is used.
	2.	Examples of machine learning applications.
